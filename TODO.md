## Tips

* Make the tower stop attacking you. Attack one of your allied creeps, even one full on HP. Under most circumstances the tower will switch to attacking whatever is closest.
* Always carry a tp. After the 5 minute mark, always carry a teleport scroll (TP). Use your TP to join fights across the map, or to run home if you're low. You can double click on a TP to teleport back to the fountain.
* Never fight uphill. You have a 25% chance to miss when attacking uphill. Standing on stairs and ramps count as being downhill.
* Mind the creep line. If the enemy has 2 more creeps than you, backup. If you have 2 more creeps than your enemy, attack them.
* You can double click on a TP to teleport back to the fountain
    * This works for items like blink dagger as well. Double click to blink towards fountain. Useful for clutch gank escapes
* Avoid "running" away from the courier, remember that the longer it takes to deliver the items to you, the longer your teammates will be without their items.
* And also be careful to not make it fly to you during fights/in non warded enemy territory or the secret shop when you have no wards/the enemy has invis heroes.

i find that numbers/timers are really important in general in dota. learning these are the best.
Roshan respawns every 10 minutes. The 3rd time he dies, he will drop cheese with the aegis.
Jungle creeps respawn every minute on the mark. If you (or a ward) are within a certain range of an empty camp, it will block the spawn at the minute mark. Lane creeps spawn every 30 seconds on the mark.
If you want to keep the lane by your tower, you have to pull at about 54 seconds away from creeps in order to make another camp spawn while the first one is gone. Having two camps will effectively stop any creeps from getting to your opponent and having your carry last hit under the tower. Learn the timings for getting lane creeps to get near said jungle creeps to make them aggro eachother.
First Night and day last 6 minutes. After that, it becomes every 12 minutes. Learning cooldowns of spells will let you know when your opponent can't use them.


Very important addition: Don't chase a kill unless you can see everybody on the map. Chasing somebody into fog is a good way to turn an almost kill for your team into two or three kills for their team.


An addendum is that ganks which take more than 5-10 seconds become HORRIBLE positioning for you or your team.
Get in, get out. Clean. Don't linger.

Most heroes vision drops tremendously at night. Many players wait till then to gank.

Tip #3: Make fewer changes and more adjustments.
People tend to do dramatic changes when things start to go wrong. This type of play style didn’t work? I should just change everything right? Wrong. Sometimes you just have to adjust a few of the details in your overall game plan in order to be more successful. Instead of using Weaver’s ultimate at 100 health, try using it at 150. Instead of going straight for Mekansm on Chen after Boots, try making Arcane Boots before getting your Mekansm. Instead of participating in team fights with Anti-Mage after the 15 minute mark, try participating in team fights after the 20 minute mark.
